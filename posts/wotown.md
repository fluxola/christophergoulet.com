This summer I set about bringing a crazy idea to fruition. I wanted a community dance party, and I wanted it to be fun and accepting of the widest possible net. All i could think about was Motown music. And thus "Wotown" was born!

If you're completely clueless as to what I'm talking about, just read the link below...

... I'm just stunned at the kind words. My good friend Taylor Long, the author, really captured the feeling and spirit of Wotown so perfectly.

Seriously, I can't thank you enough.

At some point after the last Wotown event is done, I'll write up some debriefing thoughts and post them here...
