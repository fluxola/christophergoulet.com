Automations save you from doing annoyingly repetetive things. Things such as pulling public ssh keys from your users' github page. ```keyscrape``` will do just that, and save the output in a nice, easy to read text file. You could easily use this to populate an inventory of some sort.

It's all nice and dockerized, too...
